Pullinux - A simple linux distro

scripts - contains a set of scripts I use for packaging and installing software.

plx-install - the start of a full installer which is no where near complete yet, so not usable yet, so far I've been sticking to the bash scripts for installing.

.config - the kernel config for building the 5.8.3 kernel to run in a VM.
